And these are tasks.

they currently use 'assignee id' to track assignees, which would require
a mapping from assignee name to assignee id. this might not be necessary
depending on the scale of the projects envisioned; it's mainly to stop
problems when multiple people share a name (and prevents typos etc
meaning a name is not correctly located, but without a nice ui this isn't a 
thing, since someone can easily typo an ID).
